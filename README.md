Gravel is a set of [Material Design](https://google.com/design/spec/) components for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) that was being created for a series of projects inside the eBay Mobile Innovations lab.  

It plays well with [Ambidex](https://github.com/appsforartists/ambidex) and [Funx](https://github.com/appsforartists/funx).  Like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), it embraces [inline JavaScript styles](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js).
